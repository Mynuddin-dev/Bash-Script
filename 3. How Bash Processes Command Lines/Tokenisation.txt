Tokenisation 
---------------------
Token , a sequence of caharacter that is considered as a single unit by the shell.
Bash break the command line by using metacharacters

Space 
Tab
New line
|
&
;
(   
)
<
>

Like human break a sentence by using punctuation

Then, Classify the token either its words or operator
Word: a token that doesnt contain an unquoted metacharacter
Operator : a token that contains at least one unquoted metacharacter

Difference : Words never contain unquoted metacharacters.
             Operators always contain unquoted metacharacters.

Two types of operator

control operator + Redirection operators only matter if
they are unquoted

1.Uquoted metachracters ditinguish tokens
2.Decide if token is a word or operator
3.Classify operators as control or redirection operators


Example
echo $name > out

echo(Space)$name > out -- Tokenisation
echo(Space)$name(Space)(>)(Space)out -- Found a redirection operator but no
control operators.

3 words echo,name,out and 1 redirection operator

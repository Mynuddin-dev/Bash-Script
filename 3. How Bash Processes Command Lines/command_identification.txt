Step 2 : Command identifications
-------------------------------------
Command line :
    1.Simple command 
    2.Compound command
            
1. Simple commands: are a set of words separated by sapces and terminated by either a new line or one of other
control Operators available in bash(command name, then control operator)

EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE COMMANDS:
Initial command

Example 0:
echo 1 2 3
echo(Command name)
1 2 3(Individual arguments)
Its a simple command 

Example 1:
echo a b c echo 1 2 3 (only Spaces here)
Interpreted as "one" simple command, because there are no control operators.

Example 2:
echo a b c;echo 1 2 3
This is as "two" interpreted simple commands because there is
a control operator that ends the first command.

Example 3:
echo $name > out

echo(Space)$name > out -- Tokenisation
echo(Space)$name(Space)(>)(Space)out -- Found a redirection operator but no
control operators.

3 words echo,name,out.txt

echo $name > out -- All interpreted as one simple
command, including redirection operator

2. Compound commands: These are bash’s programming constructs. They start with
a reserved word and are terminated by the corresponding
reserved words such as if statement,for loops,while loops etc.

Example : 

if [[ 2 -gt 1 ]]; then
echo “hello world”
fi
